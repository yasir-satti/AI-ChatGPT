# Build A Chatbot With The ChatGPT API In React (gpt-3.5-turbo Tutorial)

We use the new OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo model to create a ChatGPT application in React. This is one of the fastest GPT models to be released. This tutorial is great for beginners to both React and ChatGPT, and is a great portfolio project. We create a chatbot that allows you to communicate directly with the ChatGPT API, which is a project that can be applied to a vast array of React projects! This project gives you a great understanding of the ChatGPT API, even if you donâ€™t plan to replicate the project created in the video yourself.
